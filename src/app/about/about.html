                <p>Dazzling Deco is a family owned company. Jane Kotzalov, owner, has a vision of beautiful backgrounds
                    and decorations. While in nursing school, she develops ideas and manages the business. Roumen
                    Kotzalov, her dad, is the architect and set-up manager. He hand-crafts paper flowers, builds panels,
                    and carves letters. Nasi Kotzalov, her mom, is the public relations point of contact. She spreads
                    the word and gets our name out. Together, this trio is dazzling the Central Florida area with unique
                    backdrops and decorative creations! </p>
